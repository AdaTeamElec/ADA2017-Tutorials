# Syncing a fork

Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository. Commits to '''master''' will be stored in a local branch, '''upstream/master'''. Check out your fork's local '''master''' branch. Then merge branches.
```
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
```
